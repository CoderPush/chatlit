## Welcome!

Thanks for trying this out. It's super alpha, but each person can log in via Google and resume their past chat with GPT.

Limitations:

- **you have to log in again if you reload** the page (streamlit's limitation; work around later)
- openai api response can be slow, with rate limit errors sometimes (chat.openai.com has advantage)
- can only delete all chat history, not individual conversation yet (contribution welcome!)

How to help:

- report bugs to Hien or myself.
- run your code locally https://github.com/CoderPush/chatlit by asking me for .env file
