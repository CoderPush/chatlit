## Welcome!

Thanks for trying this out. It's super alpha, but each person can log in via Google and resume their past chat with GPT.

Limitations:

- you have to log in again if you reload the page (need to work around streamlit later)
- openai api gives rate limit errors sometimes, causing crashes
- gpt4 feels slower than ai.com naturally
- can't delete personal conversations yet. don't put anything sensitive there.

How to help:

- report bugs to Hien or myself.
- run your code locally https://github.com/CoderPush/chatlit by getting your own keys at .env
